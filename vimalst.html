        <p>Q) What are the different processes by which fuel oils can be purified?

            A) 1. Gravitational method i.e. put the oil in settling tank and then draining it continuously.
            
            2. By Centrifugal force in a purifier.
            
            Q) Out of the above mentioned methods which one is faster and why?
            
            A) Centrifugal method is much more better than gravitational method. Reason can be explained as follows:                                               F= m*g for gravity force                 F= (m*v^2)/r for centrifugal force
            
            the value of “g” is constant i.e 9.8 m/s^ 2. while that of (v^2)/r can be increased to thousands of times. hence centrifugal method is better and faster than gravitational method.
            
            Q) What are the difference bw purifier and clarifier?
            
            A) 1. purifier can seperate solid impurities and water both from fuel oil while clarifier can seperate only soild impurities from fuel oil.
            
            2. purifier has a gravity disc while clarifier doesnot.
