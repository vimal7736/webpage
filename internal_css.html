        <p>Marine diesel engines are very similar to the self-ignition engines in heavy-duty vehicles, but they are generally larger, more complex, and operate with higher efficiency. About 75% of all marine diesel engines are four-stroke engines; however, 75% of the installed power is produced by two-stroke engines</p>
